# Experimental Results
This document is a technical report accompanying the paper titled "Safety Assessment of UAV Operations in U-Space: A Comprehensive Study on Key Safety Metrics". It presents:

The impact of various factors on different safety metrics.

The effect of GPS faults on these metrics under different wind conditions.

The calculation of risk thresholds for critical metrics—those most sensitive to collisions—considering varying traffic levels and wind conditions.
